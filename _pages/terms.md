# Terms of Use

Cookie Blocker will try at best to delete ( or overwrite ) cookies on site that you gave permission on.
Cookie Blocker is not reliable on overwriting all cookies.
For example, HTTPONLY cookies are not visible in safari extions.
If customers really need to have all cookies deleted, we recommend using safari's incognito mode on those sites.

Cookie Blocker is only an utility helper to reduce privacy leaks by deleting/overwriting cookies.
Cookie Blocker can not 100% guarantee that your information is not leaked out.

Cookie Blocker may cause some sites to behave differently.
For instance, if customers use cookie blocker on their banking website, we can not guarantee if the site will work.
Therefore - we recommend to use Cookie Blocker at your own risk.
