# Privacy Policy

## 1.0 Information We Collect
Cookie Blocker does not collect anything. All functionality is performed on your device. There are no analytics. If we add this in the future we will let you know, but even then it would be hosted on our own servers with no tracking.
Cookie Blocker does not send any data from or to your device. Your privacy report in iOS may report the following domains
- cookie.sufiyanyasa.com
- sufiyanyasa.com

Cookie Blocker downloads a `cookie list` from the above domains. The list contains server side cookies that Safari cannot detect. (versions 2.7 will make this functionality non default and has a toggle to turn off this functionality )

### 1.2 Information you provide to us
In a future version of the app it will be possible to share your own groups with other people, but you will always need to initiate this sharing yourself and you will be given a clear warning.

### 1.3 Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### 1.4 Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and by showing a message in the app. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

### 1.4 Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at me@sufiyanyasa.com
