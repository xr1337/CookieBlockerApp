# **Version 1.0**
This is the first release.
Cookie Blocker runs as a Safari extension that allows you to block certain sites from installing cookies.
Safari has its own cookie blocking settings, but applies globally.
Users are not able to manage which sites which should allow cookies.

I build cookie blocker to overcome this limitation.

#### What's New
- Deletes cookies when ever you visit the site
- Limitation: can not delete [HTTPOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) cookies

#### Bug Fixes
- No bugs yet but I am sure they will come ..
